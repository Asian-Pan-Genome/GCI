  ## About
  Genome Continuity Inspector (GCI) is an assembly assessment tool for high-quality genomes (e.g. T2T genomes), in base resolution. After stringently filtering the alignments generated by mapping long reads (PacBio HiFi and/or Oxford Nanopore long reads) back to the genome assembly, GCI will report potential assembly issues and also a score to quantify the continuity of assembly.
